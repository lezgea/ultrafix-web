He's very knowledgeable about our GE washer and was able to run different tests to make the diagnosis and suggested the right solution. He came back in one week with replacement part and fixed it for us. Good to have the washer back! Thank you for the quality and quick service!",

He came back multiple times to be sure his assessment of the problem was correct rather than just guessing initially and potentially wasting us money. He was then able to fix the problem very quickly and our fridge is working great. He was also very courteous and responsive. I would absolutely request him as our technician again.",
